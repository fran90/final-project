<br>
<strong>Marcel Lajos Breuer</strong>, (21 May 1902 – 1 July 1981), was a Hungarian-born modernist, architect and furniture designer of Jewish descent. One of the masters of Modernism, Breuer displayed interest in modular construction and simple forms.<br>
Breuer was born on 21 May 1902 in the provincial city of Pecs, Hungary. His early study and teaching at the Bauhaus in Weimar and Dessau in the twenties introduced the wunderkind to the older giants of the era of whom three – Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and Walter Gropius – were to have life-long influence upon his professional life. <br>
By the time he left Germany in 1935 to join Gropius in London, Breuer was one of the best-known designers in Europe. His reputation was based upon his invention of tubular steel furniture, one big residence, two apartment houses, some shop interiors and several competition entries.<br>
Two years later, Gropius asked him to join Harvard’s architecture faculty and, during WWII their partnership revolutionized American house design while teaching a whole generation of soon-to-be famous architects.
<br>
On his own in New York in 1946, Breuer saw a practice that had been essentially residential finally expand into institutional buildings with the UNESCO Headquarters commission in Paris in 1952 and the first of many buildings for Saint John’s Abbey in Collegeville, MN two years later.<br>
His New York-based firm moved through three ever-larger offices, with a branch in his beloved Paris to handle work in seven European countries; he gathered five young partners in the process.
<br>
In the 1920s and 1930s, Breuer pioneered the design of tubular steel furniture. Later in his career he would also turn his attention to the creation of innovative and experimental wooden furniture.
<br>
By 1968, when he won the AIA’s Gold Medal, he could look back on such world-famous monuments as New York’s Whitney Museum (probably the best known), IBM’s La Gaude Laboratory (his personal favorite), the headquarters of the Departments of HUD and HEW in Washington DC (he finally felt American), and Flaine (an entire ski-town in the French Alps). In that same year, he won the first Jefferson Foundation Medal that cited him “among all the living architects of the world as excelling all others in the quality of his work.”

<p>
Inspired by the strength and elegance of his bicycle handlebars, budding designer Marcel Breuer approached a local bike factory manager with an idea for developing and manufacturing furniture using tubular steel. The factory manager politely dismissed him. His reason? “It has never been done”.

Had that bicycle maker possessed a little more vision, he would be a major part of design history – and possibly a very wealthy man. Because today, tubular steel “Breuer chairs” have “been done” in almost every conceivable fashion, and are arguably one of the most popular and recognisable furniture designs on the planet.

The stunning result appeared in 1925, when Breuer realised his goal of designing the first bent tubular steel chair. The Wassily Chair – which despite some claims was not designed for the artist Wassily Kandinsky – became an instant sensation. More steel-based designs followed, including his famous Laccio tables, stools, cupboards and other pieces Breuer considered “essential designs for modern living”.

The cantilevered steel chair known simply today as the “Breuer Chair” first appeared in 1928 after years of development. Usually featuring a wood and cane seat and seatback, this simple yet iconic design adheres to the strict Bauhaus principle of two sets of structures, one carrying the load and one supporting the body. These chairs were so ahead of their time that they did not reach the peak of their popularity for almost a half-century, becoming modernist must-haves in the 1970s.

He also applied the same principals used in his tubular steel pieces to plywood furniture, creating some elegant and functional new designs. All adhered to his personal philosophy, “Structure is not just a means to a solution. It is also a principle and a passion”. It is that principle and passion that has allowed Marcel Breuer’s designs to endure into the 21st century.

<p>  K40 table was designed between 1927 and 1928. It utilizes the same shapes and forms commonly seen throughout other Breuer tables. The Breuer K40 Sofa table is one of Breuer's most elegant table designs. Breuer was a pioneer, and quickly became a master, at using tubular steel. The K40 table is a fine example of Breuer's ability to bend tubular steel into a useful object for the home.
